# World Cup Stats:
## Database design and querying of World Cup statistics using SQL

### About the Project
The goal of this project is to create a relationship database containing all things World Cup: storing information from players and teams to stadiums and tournament awards. To test the database, I'm also looking to answer the following questions about past tournaments: 

* Which 5 countries have the highest all-time goal count? 
* Which 5 countries received the most number of cards during the 2010 World Cup?
* How many total points did each team in Group A receive during the 2014 World Cup? 
* How many goals have been scored against keeper Tim Howard during World Cup matches? 
* How many World Cup matches have been played at Estadio de Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil? 
* How many individual awards has Lionel Messi won?

### The Files
The project contains two files: a database diagram containing all information relevant to the World Cup; and a SQL file intended to answer the six questions listed above. The database does not actually exist, but is an exercise on creating complex, yet efficient, relational databases.
